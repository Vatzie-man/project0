Lesson 1 (Git):
*git clone <url>
*git add <filename>
*git commit -m "message" #first you 'add' and then 'commit'; and then pull (my own experience)
*git status
*git push (pushing code from CPU to GitHub)
*git pull (from GitHub to CPU)

__Merge Conflict (when local file differs against GitHub version)__

*git log (shows a history of the all changes)

*git reset --hard <commit> ## commit - all that odd numbers and letters; reset to the version represented by those numbers
*git reset --hard origin/master # reset the repository to the orgin repository from GitHub

Other:
in google: html color picker

Linux:
xdg-open 'file' - for open file


Thoughts:
*You are good at something while you can teach that confidently. Thought it is hard to reach that level. But you have a background, use it!
*Fiding a 100 000pln in 3/6 years. Be patient and eventually you will get there.

*What type of change is most conductive to a fulfilling life ?
*If you plan on being less that you are capable of being, you will propably be unhappy all the days of your life.

*Do the things you fear and the death of fear is certain.

The Road of Death - a safe road
